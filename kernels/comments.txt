Earth orientation data
======================

EARTH ITRF93 Association Kernel
-------------------------------

   This is a kernel used to designate ITRF93 as the default body-fixed
   frame associated with the Earth. The file name is

      earth_assoc_itrf93.tf

   This association kernel is a text file. See the comments in
   the file for details concerning usage.

GM/mass kernels
---------------
  
   The file 

      gm_de431.tpc

   gives "GM" (gravitational constant times mass) values for the
   sun, planets, planetary system barycenters, and selected satellites 
   asteroids. These values are based on DE-431 and latest satellite 
   ephemeris release memos. This file was provided to NAIF on 04/16/14
   by Jon D. Giorgini, Solar System Dynamics group.

EARTH_FIXED Alias Kernel
------------------------

   This is a kernel used to map the reference frame alias 
   EARTH_FIXED to a specific reference frame:

      earth_fixed.tf

   Using the alias EARTH_FIXED in code allows applications to 
   select the earth-fixed frame to use at run time via the 
   frame specification in this kernel.  The default association
   is with the frame 

      IAU_EARTH

   The file contains instructions for changing the association to
   ITRF93.

"
JPL's Solar System Dynamics Group has released two new planet ephemeris files: DE430 and DE431.
Each contains ephemeris data for the planet barycenters--Mercury through Pluto 
(NAIF ID codes 1 through 9), plus the Sun (10), the earth mass center (399) and the moon (301).
Also present are the Mercury and Venus mass centers--199 and 299 respectively--since these have
the same locations as the respective barycenters.

The difference between DE430 and DE431 is mainly in the dynamical model for the Earth's Moon.
DE430 uses a more complete dynamical model which produces a slightly more accurate ephemeris for 
the Moon. However the dynamical model used for DE430 includes a model of an excited lunar 
core/mantle rotation interaction which does not extrapolate into the distant past well. 
Therefore DE430 was integrated over a limited time span. DE431 does not include the excited 
core/mantle state so is less accurate for times near the current epoch but is more accurate for 
the distant past.

The difference in the positions of the planets agree to better than 0.001 km over the time 
period covered by DE430, a difference which is not statistically distinguished by the currently 
available data. The difference in the lunar position is less than 0.01 km over the period 
1950 to 2050.

As of the date of this posting DE430 is now considered the official lunar/planetary ephemeris, 
suitable for all users/uses.

For those whose need of a planet ephemeris can be satisfied by the DE430 time span, and for 
those in need of the most accurate JPL-produced lunar ephemeris, DE430 is now considered 
the official export ephemeris.

  Approximate time span:   1550 Jan 01 to 2650 Jan 22


For those in need of a very long planetary ephemeris, and where the degradation in the lunar 
state is not significant, DE431 provides longer coverage.
