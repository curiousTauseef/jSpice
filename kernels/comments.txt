"This SPK file was released on February 13, 2008 by the Solar System
Dynamics Group of JPL's Guidance, Navigation, and Control section.

The DE 421 planetary ephemeris is described in JPL IOM 343R-08-002,
dated Feb. 13, 2008. The introduction of that memo states, in part,
that this ephemeris "represents an overall update for all planets, and
so is suitable for use for any purpose limited by the integration time
span of approximately 1900-2050."  The memo also states that this
ephemeris "is the successor to the best previously released ephemeris
DE 418."
